    <title>Reactive Streams and Play 3.0</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Reactive Streams has a lot to offer Play, providing an asynchronous streaming API that is easy to learn and easy to use from both Java and Scala. Play 3.0 will be embracing this new API as the base level IO API, but what implications will this have on Play's architecture? What will happen to iteratees? How much will this impact existing Play applications? This presentation will dive deep into Play's architecture, and show just how reactive streams will be applied to and improve Play." />
